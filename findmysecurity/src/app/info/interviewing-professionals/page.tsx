          A warm, professional welcome can help ease any tension and set the tone for a constructive interview. Offer the candidate a tea or coffee, and if appropriate, provide a brief introduction to the premises, team, or family members they may be safeguarding. While an initial informal chat can help build rapport, it's best to conduct the main interview in private to maintain focus and confidentiality.
