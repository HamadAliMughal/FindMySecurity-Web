        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          Many security companies and self-employed officers collaborate in local networks or teams, covering for each other when needed. During interviews or onboarding, it’s good practice to ask whether backup arrangements are in place or if an individual officer is part of a professional response network.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          The best way to manage risk is to plan ahead. We recommend:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>Pre-screening a shortlist of professionals who can be called upon</li>
          <li>Arranging introductory shifts or shadowing days</li>
          <li>Completing documentation (e.g. ID checks, insurance verifications) in advance</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
          This ensures that when the time comes, your substitute professional is already familiar with the role, reducing stress for you and your client or venue.
