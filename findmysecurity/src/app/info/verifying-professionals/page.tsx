      <section className="mb-8">
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          It is essential to thoroughly verify any security professional, contractor, or company before engaging their services. Choosing the right security personnel is a serious decision, whether for private hire, site protection, public safety events, or executive protection. It is your responsibility to ensure that the individual or company you contract has the right credentials, legal eligibility, and trustworthy track record to deliver their duties safely and professionally.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Key Checks to Carry Out</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          We strongly recommend creating a checklist for verifying documents and conducting interviews. Below are the key areas to assess before entering into any contract or assignment agreement.
        </p>

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">SIA Licence & Insurance</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
            All frontline security professionals in the UK must hold a valid Security Industry Authority (SIA) licence appropriate to their role (e.g., Door Supervisor, Close Protection, CCTV Operator). This can be verified on the official{' '}
            <a href="https://www.sia.homeoffice.gov.uk" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">SIA Register</a>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            In addition, self-employed professionals and private security companies must hold up-to-date public liability insurance. Always request proof of this insurance before contracting a service.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Criminal Record Checks (DBS) and Vetting</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
            Before hiring, request to see a valid Enhanced DBS check, which reveals spent and unspent convictions, cautions, warnings, and whether the individual is barred from working with vulnerable groups. Many employers also conduct background checks via the BS 7858:2019 standard, which includes:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li>Identity verification</li>
            <li>Five-year employment history review</li>
            <li>Character references</li>
            <li>Address verification</li>
            <li>Right to Work checks</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            For contractors who have served in the Armed Forces or government security roles, military references or security clearance levels (e.g., SC, DV) may also be available and relevant.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Note: A DBS certificate is only accurate as of the day it was issued. The DBS Update Service allows real-time checks for changes, ask if the candidate is subscribed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">ID Verification & Right to Work</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Always check two forms of ID, one photographic (passport, driving licence) and one showing proof of address (utility bill, bank statement). You must also verify their legal right to work in the UK. Guidance is available from{' '}

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Training & Qualifications</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
            Security professionals should be able to present SIA-linked qualification certificates (e.g., Door Supervision, CCTV, First Aid). For specialist roles, check for qualifications such as:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li>Close Protection Level 3</li>
            <li>CCTV Operation Level 2</li>
            <li>Spectator Safety or Event Security NVQs</li>
            <li>Physical Intervention or Conflict Management certifications</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Additional training such as First Aid at Work, Fire Safety, or Mental Health First Aid is recommended and often expected for event-based or lone working roles.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Vehicle Documents (If Driving Is Involved)</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
            If a professional will be transporting assets or individuals, check that their vehicle documentation is valid and includes:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li>Business class vehicle insurance</li>
            <li>Valid MOT</li>
            <li>Vehicle tax status</li>
            <li>Driving licence check</li>
            <li>Roadside assistance cover</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Also check if the vehicle is appropriate and if security modifications (dash cams, lockboxes, etc.) are present where applicable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">References and Previous Employment</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Request references from past clients or employers within the security industry. A reliable security professional should be able to supply verifiable feedback from their most recent assignments or employers, ideally covering the last 5 years.

        <p className="text-gray-700">

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Face-to-Face Interviews</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          We strongly advise that all businesses and individuals conduct a face-to-face interview with any security professional before engaging their services. For initial meetings, consider arranging to meet in a public and neutral setting such as a coffee shop, reception area, or office space.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          During the interview, you should ask detailed questions about the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and background. Always request to see original copies of key documents, such as:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>SIA Licence</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">References</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          It is essential to obtain reliable references for any prospective security professional or company. Reputable personnel should be able to supply professional references from previous clients, contracts, or employers. Where a candidate is newly qualified or self-employed, you may consider accepting character references or academic references.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          We recommend contacting referees directly by phone rather than relying solely on written testimonials or emails.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">Suggested questions include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>How long have you known the professional?</li>
          <li>In what capacity have they worked with or for you?</li>
          <li>What was their role and what responsibilities did they hold?</li>
          <li>How did they perform in areas such as punctuality, discipline, reliability, professionalism under pressure, and communication?</li>
          <li>Would you hire or recommend them again?</li>
          <li>Why did they leave their position (if applicable)?</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
          For those seeking live-in roles (e.g., close protection or residential security), you may also want to ask lifestyle or conduct-related questions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
          You may also consider using specialist reference checking services such as Verifile or RefNow, which provide structured employment verification.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          Verified businesses and individuals who have used a security professional through FindMySecurity are encouraged to leave public reviews. These reviews are visible on the professional’s profile and can be a helpful indicator of quality, conduct, and reliability.
        </p>

          If a professional has been listed for a significant period but has no reviews, it may be worth discussing this with them during the vetting process.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          Security professionals committed to excellence will usually provide supporting documentation such as:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>Training logs and completion certificates (e.g., SIA-linked qualifications, First Aid, Fire Safety)</li>

          <li>Employment contracts, licences, or accreditations (e.g., ISO certification, NSI/ACS membership)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Additional Online Research</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">
          As part of your due diligence, consider carrying out your own online research. Public social media profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, or X) may provide insight into a candidate's professionalism, communication style, and public persona.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">Ask yourself:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>Do they behave professionally online?</li>
          <li>Are they discreet about client information or assignments?</li>
          <li>Do their activities align with your organisation’s values or risk tolerance?</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
          You may also search for any public disciplinary or criminal records, previous company directorships, or mentions in trade forums.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
          This approach complements formal verification steps and can help build a well-rounded picture of the person or business you're considering.
